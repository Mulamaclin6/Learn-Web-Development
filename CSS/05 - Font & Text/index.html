    <p class="first">Lorem Ipsum
        Lorem ipsum is placeholder text 
        commonly used in the graphic, print,
         and publishing industries for previewing 
         layouts and visual mockups.</p><br />
         <p class="second"> What is Lorem Ipsum?
            From its medieval origins to the digital
             era, learn everything there is to know 
             about the ubiquitous lorem ipsum passage.</p><br />
             <p class="third">Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes
                 known, is dummy text used in laying out 
                 print, graphic or web designs. The passage
                  is attributed to an unknown typesetter in 
                  the 15th century who is thought to have 
                  scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus 
                  Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen
                   book. It usually begins with:</p><br />
                   <p class="fourth"> “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
                     adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor 
                     incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”</p><br />
                     <p class="fifth">The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural 
                        looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, 
                        etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice 
                        not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless
                         filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to 
                         be on design, not content.</p>

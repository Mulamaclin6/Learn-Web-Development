        <p> What is lorem ipsum?
            Lorem ipsum, sometimes called "lipsum," is 
            a form of placeholder text that mimics the 
            natural visual flow of content in a space. 
            The phrase "lorem ipsum" derives from the 
            Latin phrase "dolorem ipsum," which translates
             to "pain itself." Lorem ipsum text often appears
              to readers as a segment of Latin text, but the 
              text actually uses a scrambled mixture of Latin 
              elements and made-up words or phases. The placeholder
               text is meaningless, and designers in print and digital 
               industries use it as it allows them to focus on the design 
            of the project instead of the content.</p>
